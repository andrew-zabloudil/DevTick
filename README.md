# DevTick
A ticket tracking webapp for development.

# Features
Users can register an account which will allow them to create projects of their own or be added as a member of another user's project.

Once in project view, users can view all of the tickets associated with that project.

Depending upon the user's role, they may be granted additional privileges as well.

Creators and Admins can edit the project information and add users to or remove users from the project as well as change the user roles of users other than the creator.

The above two roles and Editors can create and edit tickets associated with the project.

Viewers may view the project, but cannot make any changes.
